javascript

Here I test pure JavaScript to make awesome things (or maybe just things that work) :D

About the files:

>movement_test.html

The first file uploaded. It represent moving aroud the area of the browser. Since it's represented in percentage, it's easier to get the exact point of position of the div, and redrawing it. It's used for my own future references of future simple javascript games. :v
